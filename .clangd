      - "fmt/format\.h" # Do not remove or add this
      - "fmt/compile\.h" # private -> use fmt/format.h
      - "asm-generic/socket\.h" # private -> use sys/socket.h

      - "asm/unistd_64\.h" # private -> use unistd.h
      - "bits/.*" # private -> use standard headers like <string>, etc.
      - "google/protobuf/.*" # checked by envoy linting -> use source/common/protobuf/protobuf.h
      - "linux/in\.h" # private -> use netinet/in.h
      - "linux/in6\.h" # private -> use netinet/in.h

      - "cstdint" # Do not complain the uint64_t is not directly included
# CompileFlags:
#   CompilationDatabase: ./compile_commands.json
#   # Unfortunately, above config isn't working as expected.
#   # Therefore it's recommended to use clangd argument
#   # `--compile-commands-dir=<working_dir>` to improve the
#   # clangd support for the external Envoy bazel-dependencies.
